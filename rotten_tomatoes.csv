It intoxicates all the same.
6375,1 hr. 37 min.,David Gordon Green,2015,Al Pacino,Holly Hunter,Harmony Korine,Chris Messina,Natalie Wilemon,Marisa Varela,49,28,"At least we get Pacino and Hunter. We may not understand why this story appealed to them, except for the fact that it gave them a chance to work together.","Sure, there's an undeniable pleasure from watching Pacino and Hunter work the screen, but the syrupy, symbol-heavy script by first-time feature writer Paul Logan is weighed down further by cliches and false notes.","If Manglehorn is to be remembered at all, it shall be for the excruciating first date that its title character goes on with a chirpy bank clerk he has long been chatting up.",This is definitely a lonely-man-talking-to-his-cat movie.,You can tell Pacino is committed to the role because he hasn't washed his hair.

Cyler,Olivia Cooke,Nick Offerman,Connie Britton,Molly Shannon,81,88,"The biggest flaw in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is right there in the title: the first word, specifically.","A very ingenous prank, maybe a little too self aware, and not as good as the great films it pays homage to.

White,Stephen Baldwin,Rebecca St. James,Candace Cameron-Bure,Sean McGowan,10,59,"It's obnoxious, to say the least, to use the Vietnam War as an excuse to affirm the importance of telling all and sundry about Jesus at all times (i.e., ""testifying""), under all circumstances.","A clumsily told story of friendship and wartime remembrance that has a tough time serving up a halfway believable moment, let alone a moving and powerful testimony about the Lordship of Jesus Christ.","This evangelical ""Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam"" by way of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" takes a mighty ridiculous route to righteousness.","War drama has combat scenes, heavy-handed message.",Message about heroics and bravery comes too late in the movie to overcome the mess that preceded it.

Those classics had thrills and gore galore. This is just too tame to terrify.,"The Vatican Tapes has presumably been released with Hallowe'en scares in mind, but the movie only induces hilarity, with some of the daftest exorcism scenes you'll see."

The unrest it creates looms long after the end credits have rolled.","A robust thriller with a questionable, although intriguing, commentary on motherhood and mental illness.",Mr. Costanzo's attempt at rendering the fraying of minds and marital bonds draws on notions of hysteria that only shortchange his characters.

By the end, it's more like it's-a-wrap than the messy, crumpled-up drafts of life.",Delevingne is plain. The soundtrack is flat and bland. The film photography satisfy but does not provide. Cinematically is average with the usual voiceover that solves all kinds of problems.

More, please, more.","Though the movie at times feels oddly unfinished (you wonder what Miranda Richardson, in a tiny role as an Oxford professor, is there for), it's artful and moving.","As a story, it evokes a word that no battlefield nurse would ever apply to her experiences: sterile.",Testament of Youth isn't a typical biopic; it's a heartfelt manual on forging ahead.,"Beneath all that genre eye candy, though, resides a smart and moving story that, after a somewhat slow-moving first hour, builds nicely to become an emotionally engaging drama."
